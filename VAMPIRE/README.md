Uses code from https://github.com/kukionfr/VAMPIRE_open, but is modified to use already generated labels and save these labels in the VAMPIRE_datasheet.csv file. Additionally, bdpc2 were added to vampire_model dictionary output (model pickle file), which are the svd transformed x and y coordinates of the cell boundaries. Score is also located in the output file and it contains the PCA transformed coordinates. pc in the output are the eigenvectors (principal components).
